We finished everything but time. 
Get the lastest copy of main and whatever changes you want to make, do it there.
We are no longer using parser.h
  Incorporate that into main.cpp
Also, there is a nextTime string available to you
  It holds the time of the next line


Hasib @10pm:
I'm trying to get the time and data portion fixed because the next-time string is what we should've been using the whole time.
I just need some more time to get it to compile properly and I'll push it onto my branch and make a Pull request, trying to get this done before 12.
